# HackBio_biocoding_internship
 This repository documents my journey through the HackBio BioCoding Internship program, where I worked on various simple bioinformatics projects to develop my skills in programming, data analysis, and problem-solving.

# Projects Overview
This repository contains a collection of projects that demonstrate my expertise in bioinformatics programming, data analysis, and visualization. Each project addresses a specific problem or question in bioinformatics, and includes:

- Well-documented code in Python
- Readme files providing context, methodology, and results for each project
