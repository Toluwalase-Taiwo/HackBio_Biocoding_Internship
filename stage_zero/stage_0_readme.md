# Team Histidine Intern Database

This Python project creates and manages a database of intern information for Team Histidine. It stores details about each intern including their personal information, academic background, and programming preferences.

## Data Structure

The database is organized using nested Python dictionaries:
- Each intern's information is stored in an individual dictionary
- All intern dictionaries are combined into a master dictionary called `intern_details`
- Interns are indexed as 'Intern1', 'Intern2', etc.

## Data Fields
Each intern record contains the following information:

name: Full name of the intern
slack username: Identifier used on Slack platform
email: Contact email address
hobby: Personal interests and activities
country: Country of residence
discipline: Academic background/field of study
preferred programming lang: Primary programming language

## Usage

The script demonstrates basic dictionary operations:
1. Creating individual intern dictionaries
2. Combining them into a master dictionary
3. Printing the complete database
4. Accessing specific fields (demonstrated with accessing an intern's name)

## Current Team Members

The database currently contains information for 6 interns from various countries and academic backgrounds:
- Nigeria (4 interns)
- Spain (1 intern)
- South Africa (1 intern)
